      <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        As an aspiring IT professional, I have earned several
        industry-recognized certifications including CompTIA A+, Network+, and
        Security+, along with AWS Cloud Practitioner, LPI Linux Essentials, and
        ITIL 4 Foundation. My technical knowledge encompasses hardware
        troubleshooting, network configuration, cybersecurity fundamentals, and
        IT service management frameworks. Through coursework and hands-on lab
        environments, I have developed strong analytical thinking and a
        methodical approach to solving complex technical problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        My comprehensive certification portfolio demonstrates my dedication to
        mastering current industry standards and best practices. I am skilled at
        translating technical concepts for diverse audiences and collaborating
        effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Whether
        working with network configurations, implementing security protocols, or
        understanding service delivery processes, I bring attention to detail
        and a commitment to continuous learning to every challenge. I am eager
        to apply these foundational skills to support organizational IT
        infrastructure and contribute to efficient technology operations.
